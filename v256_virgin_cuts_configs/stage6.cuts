# Lower limit for the theta-square cut. Only used in MakeEA 
# and vaStage5. Not used in vaStage6. Units are degrees^2. 
# [def. 0] 
ThetaSquareLower 0

# Upper limit for the theta-square cut. Explicitly NOT used 
# in vaStage6 (even though its listed in the cuts file 
# produced by vaStage6). This cut can and should only be 
# used with makeEA (makeEffectiveArea) and it will be used 
# by default in vaStage5 where you probably want to set it 
# large (the default value should be good enough) so that it 
# is ineffectual. For Stage6 you should use the parameters 
# associated with each background model: 
# -RBM_SearchWindowSqCut (for RBM) and -S6A_RingSize (for 
# Wobble/reflected area model). Note that when generating 
# spectra in vaStage6 a check is made comparing the 
# ThetaSquareUpper value used to generate the Effective Area 
# File (with makeEA) and the value of S6A_RingSize used in 
# the spectral analyis (which uses the reflected area 
# model). Units for ThetaSquareUpper are degrees^2. [def.
